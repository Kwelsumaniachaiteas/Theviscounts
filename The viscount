        <p>Dear [duchess],</p>
        <p>I have something important to ask you. After spending so much time together, sharing memories, and experiencing many special moments, I can't imagine my life without you. You make me incredibly happy, and I feel that our connection is truly something special.</p>
        <p>[it’s been a wonderful journey with you and every single step has been worth it.I fell in love with your eyes and your aura and now I want a taste of what forever feels like, as long as it’s at beaches getting tipsy with you, restaurants, giggling and analyzing other couples with you, warm mornings and sunny afternoon walks with you, a billion more collaborative articles with someone who’s intellect genuinely excites me and a lot more late night car rides with my hand up your thighs .]</p>
        <p>So, [my dearest duchess], I want to officially ask you, to be my girlfriend?</p>
        <p>I hope that you'll say yes and continue this beautiful journey with me. Together, I believe we can create a future filled with love, laughter, and countless adventures.</p>
        <p>Please let me know your answer and make me the happiest person on earth!</p>
        <p>With all my love, [the viscount ]</p>
